# Web Push Example in ASP NET Core 3.1 Using Csharp-Web-Push

This repo is an update on [Web Push Demo in ASP NET Core](https://github.com/coryjthompson/WebPushDemo).

The original repo is outdated and has many issues. The project won't even run and many of its packages are now depricated.

This example is tested on Chrome, Edge, Opera and Chrome Android.

Feel free to send issues on this repo. I will check them as soon as I can
